# StormAnalysis
How to develop a supervised regression model with publicly available data.

0. Brief Introduction
1. Data Collection
2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Training, Testing and Modeling
4. Evaluation

Inspired by my own endeavours with publicly available storm data. 

Achieving successful, model deployable metrics is very possible for anyone who is looking to find patterns and solutions to problems. If you're a seasoned data scientist, a hobbyist engineer, or someone who's never touched Python in their life-- you will have no trouble learning how to deploy this fundamental skill which is the theme of this repository: finding patterns in data. Anyone can find trends, create solutions, and evaluate situations with statistical analysis and evidence-based decision making.
