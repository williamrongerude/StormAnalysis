How to develop a supervised regression model with publicly available data.

1. Data Collection
2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Training, Testing and Modeling
4. Evaluation

Inspired by own endeavours with publicly available storm data, engineering my own model to achieve successful, model deployable metrics that you can achieve as well!
