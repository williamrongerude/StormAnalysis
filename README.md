How to develop a supervised regression model with publicly available data.

1. Data Collection
2. Cleaning & Feature Engineering
3. Training, Testing and Modeling
4. Evaluation

Inspired by own endeavours with publicly available storm data. Achieving successful, model deployable metrics is very possible for anyone who is looking to find patterns and solutions to problems, even ones who've never touched Python in their life.
