It didn't generalize in testing, and it didn't reflect a real relationship. We were feeding the model noise-- and any model, especially flexible ones, can force a fit onto any set of numbers. High-capacity models like Neural Networks will memorize every little piece of noise and therefore overfit more. Noisey features won't generalize, and they certaintly wont become the key features that explains your outcomes.
